Perfect! I've created a complete enrollment system for your elementary school (grades 1-6). Here's what I built:

Enrollment System Summary
Core Components:
Enrollment Model (models.py)

Links students to sections with grade levels 1-6
Tracks enrollment status (ACTIVE, COMPLETED, DROPPED, PENDING)
Records academic year (e.g., "2024-2025")
Ensures unique enrollment per student-section-grade-year combination
API Endpoints - Full CRUD + custom actions:

GET/POST /api/enrollments/ - List/create enrollments
GET /api/enrollments/{id}/ - Get enrollment details
PATCH /api/enrollments/{id}/ - Update enrollment
DELETE /api/enrollments/{id}/ - Delete enrollment
Custom Actions:

/by_student/?student_id=X - Get all enrollments for a student
/by_section/?section_id=X - Get all enrollments in a section
/by_grade/?grade_level=X - Get enrollments by grade
/active_enrollments/ - Get only active enrollments
/statistics/ - Get enrollment statistics by grade and status
/{id}/mark_completed/ - Complete an enrollment
/{id}/mark_dropped/ - Drop an enrollment
/{id}/mark_active/ - Activate an enrollment
Admin Interface - Manage enrollments easily with filters and search
